How can you **learn the most from a book** — or any other piece of writing — when you're reading  for information, rather than for pleasure? 

 It’s satisfying to start at the beginning and read straight through to the end. Somebooks, such as  novels, have to be readthis way, since a basic principle of fiction is to hold the reader in  suspense. Your whole purpose in readingfiction is to follow the writer’s lead, allowing him or  her to spin a story bit by bit. 

But many of the books, articles, and other documents you’ll read during your undergraduate  and graduate years, and possibly during the rest of your professional life, won’t be novels.  Instead, *they’ll be non-fiction*: textbooks,manuals, journal articles, histories, academic studies,  and so on. 

The purpose of reading things like this is to gain, and retain, information. Here, *finding out what  happens — as quickly and easily as possible* —is **your main goal**. So unless you’re stuck in prison  with nothing else to do,  **NEVER**  read a non-fiction book or article *from beginning to end*. 

Instead, when you’re reading for information, you should  **ALWAYS**  *jump ahead, skip around, and  use every available strategy* to discover, then to understand, and finally to remember what the  writer has to say. *This is how you’ll get the most out of a book in the smallest amount of time*. 

Using the methods described here, you should be able to read a 300 page book in six to eight  hours. Of course, the more time you spend, the more you’ll learn and the better you’ll  understand the book. But *your time is limited*. 

Here are some strategies to help you do this effectively. Most of these can be applied not only  to books, but also to any other kind of nonfiction reading, from articles to websites. Table 1, on  the next page, summarizes the techniques, and the following pages explain them in more detail.

## Read the whole thing!

In reading to learn, your goal should always be to get all the way through the assignment.  It’s much more important to **have a general grasp** of the arguments or hypotheses,  evidence, and conclusions *than to understand every detail*. In fact, no matter how carefully  you read, *you won’t remember most of the details anyway*. 

What you can do is remember and record **the main points**. And if you remember those, you  know enough to find the material again if you ever do need to recall the details. 

 （无论读得多仔细，细节总会遗忘。我们要做的是，记住主要论点。）

## Decide how much time you will spend

If you know in advance that you *have only six hours to read,* it’ll be easier to pace yourself.  Remember, you’re going to read the whole book (or the whole assignment).

In fact, the more directly and realistically you confront your limits, the more effective you  will be at practically everything. **Setting time limits and keeping to them** (while  accomplishing your goals) is *one of the most important life skills* you can learn. *So never start to read without planning when to stop*.

（设定截止时间（time limit），一定要确定何时之前读完）

## Have a purpose and a strategy

Before you begin, **figure out why you are reading this particular book**, and **how you are going to read it**. If you don’t have reasons and strategies of your own — not just those of  your teacher — you won’t learn as much.

As soon as you start to read, begin trying to **find out four things**:

- Who is the author?
- What are the book’s *arguments*?  
- What is the *evidence* that supports these?
- What are the book’s *conclusions*?

Once you’ve got a grip on these, start trying to determine:

- What are the weaknesses of these arguments, evidence, and conclusions?  
- What do you think about the arguments, evidence, and conclusions?  
- How does (or how could) the author respond to these weaknesses, andto  your own criticisms?

Keep coming back to these questions as you read. **By the time you finish, you should be able  to answer them all**. *Three good ways* to think about this are:

1. Imagine that you’re going to review the book for a magazine.
2. Imagine that you’re having a conversation, or a formal debate, with the  author. 
3. Imagine an examination on the book. What would the questions be, and how  would you answer them?

（带着问题读书。书读完了，问题也该解决了。论点、证据、结论，批判性阅读。）

## Read actively

Don’t wait for the author to hammer you over the head. Instead, from the very beginning, **constantly generate hypotheses** (“the main point of the book is that...”) and questions  (“How does the author know that...?”) about the book.

Making brief notes about these can help. As you read, **try to confirm your hypotheses and  answer your questions**. Once you finish, review these.

（主动思考，而不是让作者喂到嘴里。试着证实你的假设和回答自己的问题。）

## Know the author(s) and organizations

Knowing who wrote a book helps you judge its quality and understand its full significance**.  Authors are people. Like anyone else, their views are shaped by their educations, their jobs,  their early lives, and the rest of their experiences. Also like anyone else, *they have  prejudices, blind spots, desperate moments,failings, and desires* — as well as insights,  brilliance, objectivity, and successes. *Notice all of it*.

*Most authors belong to organizations*: universities, corporations, governments, newspapers,  magazines. These organizations each have cultures, hierarchies of power, and social norms.  Organizations shape both how a work is written and the content of what it says. For  example, university professors are expected to write books and/or journal articles inorder  to get tenure. These pieces of writing must meet certain standards of quality, defined chiefly  by other professors; *for them, content usually matters more than good writing*. Journalists,  by contrast, are often driven by deadlines and *the need to please large audiences*. Because  of this, their standards of quality are often directed more toward clear and engaging writing  than toward unimpeachable content; their sources are usually oral rather than written.

The more you know about the author and his/her organization and/or discipline, *the better  you will be able to evaluate what you read*. Try to answer questions like these: What shaped  the author’s intellectual perspective? What is his or her profession? **Is the author an  academic,a journalist, a professional** (doctor, lawyer, industrial scientist, etc.)?Expertise?  Other books and articles?Intellectual network(s)? Gender? Race? Class? Political affiliation?  *Why did the author decide to write this book?*When? For what audience(s)? Who paid for  the research work (private foundations, government grant agencies, industrial sponsors,  etc.)? Who wrote “jacket blurbs” in support ofthe book?

You can often (though not always) learn about much of this from the acknowledgments, the  bibliography, and the author’s biographical statement.

（你需要知道作者的身份，知道他的背景、喜好，是偏重内容，还是偏重文风，是教授，还是记者？）

## Know the intellectual context

 Knowing the author and his/her organization also helps you understand the book’s  intellectual context. This includes the academic discipline(s) from which it draws, schools of  thought within that discipline, and others who agree with or oppose the author’s viewpoint.

A book is almost always partly a response to other writers, so you’ll understanda book  much better if *you can figure out what, and whom, it is answering*. Pay special attention to  points where the author tells you directly that s/he is disagreeing with others:  “Conventional wisdom holds that x, but I argue instead that y.” (Is x really conventional  wisdom? Among what group of people?) “Famous Jane Scholar says that x, but I will show  that y.” (Who’s Famous Jane, and why do other people believe her? How plausible are x and  y? Is the author straining to find something original to say, or has s/he genuinely convinced  you that Famous Jane is wrong?) Equally important are the people and writings the author  cites in support of his/her arguments.

（明白作者写这本书的目的，他想申明什么观点？他在驳斥什么观点？）

## Read it three times

This is the key technique**. You’ll get the most out of the book if you **read it three times —  each time for a different purpose**.  

### a) Overview: discovery (5-10percent of total time)

**Here you read very quickly**, following the principle (described below) of reading for high information content. Your goal is to **discover the book**. You  want a quick and dirty, unsophisticated, *general picture of the writer’s  purpose, methods, and conclusions*.

Mark — without reading carefully — headings,passages, and phrases **that  seem important** (you’ll read these more closely the second time around.)  Generate questions to answer on your second reading: what does term or  phrase X mean?Why doesn’t the author cover subject Y? Who is Z?

（概览，花10%的时间左右纵览全书，标记看上去重要的关键词，问自己，那些词什么意思？作者为什么提及？）

### b) Detail: understanding (70-80 percent oftotal time)

Within your time constraints, read the book a second time. This time, your  goal is understanding: to get a careful, critical, thoughtful grasp of **the key  points**, and to *evaluate the author’s evidence for his/her points*.

Focus especially on the beginnings and ends of chapters and major sections.  Pay special attention to the passages you marked on the first round. Try to  answer any questions you generated on the first round.

（找到key points，评估作者的证据。特别留意章节的开头和结尾。）

### c) Notes: recall and note taking (10-20percent of total time)

The purpose of your third and final reading is to **commit to memory the  most important elements of the book**. This time, make brief notes about the  *arguments, evidence, and conclusions*. This is not at all the same thing as  text markup; your goal here is to process the material by **translating into  your ownmental framework**, *which means using your own words as much  as possible*. Cutting and pasting segments of text from the book will not do  as much for you as **summarizing very briefly in your own words**. Include the  bare minimum of detail to let you remember and relocate the most  important things. **1-3pages of notes per 100 pages of text is a good goal to  shoot for; more than that is often too much**. Use some system that lets you  easily find places in the book (e.g., start each note with a page number.)

（用自己的话总结，而不是大段抄录原文。试着简洁地总结出来，比单纯的复制有效得多。100页的书，有1-3页的笔记就够了，否则就太多了。用些方法，让你更易找到原文出处）

**Notebooks, typed pages, or handwritten sheet stucked into the book can all  work**. However, *notes will be useless unless you can easily find them again*.  A very good system — the one I use — is to type notes directly into  bilbiography entries using citation manager software such as Endnote,  Zotero, or Bookends. See below for more on citation managers.  

（用一个外部系统，方便自己找到原文）

## On time and timing

First, because **human attention fades after about an hour**, you’ll get more out of three one  hour readings than you could ever get out of one three hour reading. But be careful: to get  one full hour of effective reading, you need to set aside at least one hour and fifteen  minutes, since distraction is inevitable at the beginning (settling in) and end (re arousal for  your next task) of any reading period.

Second, make a realistic plan that includes how much time you will devote to each of the  three stages. For a 250 page book, I might spend 15 minutes on overview, 4 hours on  detailed reading, and 20-30 minutes making notes — but I'd adjust these periods up or  down depending on how difficult the text is,how important it is to me, and how much time I  have.

（集中1小时的注意力，你至少需要拨出1小时15分钟的时间，因为我们容易分心。）（仔细规划每阶段的阅读时间比如一本250页的书，15分钟略读大概，4个小时阅读全文，20-30分钟做笔记。这取决于你读的书。）

## Focus on the parts with high information content

Nonfiction books very often have **an “hourglass” structure** that is repeated at several levels  of organization. More general (broader) information is typically presented at *the beginnings  and ends* of:

- the book or article as a whole (abstract, introduction, conclusion)  
- each chapter 
- each section within a chapter
- each paragraph

More specific (narrower) information (supporting evidence, details, etc.) then appears in the  middle of the hourglass.

You can make the hourglass structure of writing do a lot of work for you. Focus on the  following elements, in more or less the following order:

- Front and back covers, inner jacket flaps  
- Table of contents  
- Index: scan this tosee which are the most important terms  
- *Bibliography*: tells you about the book’s sources and intellectual context  
- Preface and/or Introduction and/or Abstract  
- Conclusion  
- Pictures,graphs, tables, figures: images contain more information than text  
- Chapter introductions and conclusions 
- Section headings  
- Special type or formatting: boldface, italics, numbered items, lists

（沙漏结构，前言、目录、序、参考文献、结论更重要）

## UsePTML (personal text markup language)

**Always, always, always mark up your reading.** This is a critical part of active reading.Do this  from the very beginning — *even on your first, overview reading*. Why? Because when you come back to the book later, *your marks reduce the amount you have to look at* and help  you see what’s most significant.

**Don’t mark too much**. This defeats the purpose of markup; when you consult your markup  later, heavy markup will force you to reread unimportant information. *As a rule, you should  average no more than two or three short marks per page*. Rather than underline whole  sentences, underline words or short phrases that capture what you most need to  remember.The point of this is to distill, reduce, eliminate the unnecessary. Write words and  phrases in the margins that tell you what paragraphs or sections are about. **Use your own words**.

（一定要做标记，但不要标记太多。每页不得超过三个。在书的边缘，用自己的话写上备忘。）

## Page vs. screen

 Printed material has far higher resolution (~600 dpi) than even the best computer screens  (~100 dpi); see the illustration of 300 vs. 600 dpi, below. For this reason *you will read more  accurately, and with less fatigue, if you stick with the paper version*. Still, we inevitably read  much more screen based material now.

![](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/197369-507a88a8af4a3e81.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

**Markup on the screen**: It remains difficult to mark up screen based materials effectively.  The extra steps involve dare distracting, as is the temptation to check email or web surf.  Also, with screen based markup you often have to click on a note in order to read it, which  means you’re less likely to do it later. *It remains far easier to mark up a printed copy!*

However, if you’re disciplined, recent versions of Acrobat, Apple Preview, and thirdparty  PDF viewers such as PDFpen, iAnnotate, and Goodreader allow you to add comments,  highlighting, and so on to PDFs. Voicerecognition can make this a lot easier. Today, I  routinely read and annotate PDFs on an i Pad,using voice recognition when I want to make a  note. Some of these readers, as well as ebookreaders **such as Kindle, allow you to export  only your highlights and notes**. This is a great way to make yourself a condensed version of a  document. *Paste it into the notes field of your citation manager and it’ll always be at your  fingertips*. Hunt around on the web for ways to do this kind of thing on an industrial scale  (especially with Kindle books).

When taking notes about something you're reading (as opposed to marking up the text),  you'll be tempted to cut and paste the original text in lieu of making your own notes in your  own words. *Cut and paste can sometimes workwell, especially for things you might want to  quote later*. **However**: in general it defeats the two main purposes of note taking: (a)  learning and remembering (by rephrasing in your own terms), and (b) condensing into a very  short form. The same is true of links: though useful for keeping track of sources, keeping a  URL will not by itself help you remember or understand what's there, even though it may  feel that way.

（纸质书更好。电子版用pdf标记软件和kindle导入。为方便以后引用，可以摘录原文。但这样的坏处是，1. 记不住 2. 丧失了提炼关键信息的机会。插入URL不会让你记得更牢。）

## Use a citation manager

It’s hard to overemphasize the huge advantages of citation manager software such as  Endnote, Bookends, Zotero, Mendeley, CiteULike, etc. They let you keep track of your  growing library, easily enter and format citations in your word processor (saving you the  incredible irritation of doing it yourself). Most of them can pull in citations directly from the  web, record web links, find DOI’s, and so on.Some have their own web search tools built in.  Some, such as Bookends (Mac only), will automatically rename documents with Author  Date Title, a huge help with the extremely annoying problem of uninformative filenames.  None of these packages are perfect. All have both advantages and disadvantages, and the  more sophisticated ones have steep learning curves. Look for one that can handle all major  document formats, including books, journalarticles, newspaper articles, online sources,  interviews, and so on. Be wary of managersthat only handle PDFs, since so many other  formats are still important.

 If you use the notes field of your citation manager in a disciplined way, your notes will  always be easy to find. When your library starts reaching into the thousands of items, this is  a godsend.

（用文献管理软件。知识管理，文献管理。）

## Use your unconscious mind

An awful lot of thinking and mental processing goes on when you’re not aware of it. Just as  with writing or any other creative thought process, full understanding of a book takes time  to develop.

Like the body, the mind suffers from fatigure when doing just one thing for many hours.  Your ability to comprehend and retain what you read drops off dramatically after an hour or  so. **Therefore, you should read a book in several short sessions of one to two hours apiece,  rather than one long marathon**.

In between, your unconscious mind will process some of what you’ve read. *When you come  back for the next session, start by asking yourself what you remember from your previous  reading, what you think of it so far, and what you still need to learn*.

（潜意识。读书不能花太多时间。切成几个小周期，没个周期开始前复习一下之前的内容。）

## Rehearse, and use multiple modes

Reading is exactly like martial arts,baseball, or cooking in the sense that **learning and  memory depend crucially on rehearsal**.

So — after you’ve read the book, rehearse what you’ve learned. Quiz yourself on its  contents. Argue with the author. Imagine how you would defend the author’s position in  your own writing.

Reading, writing, speaking, listening, andvisualizing all engage different parts of the brain.  For this reason, *the best forms of rehearsal use multiple modes of thinking and action*.  *Don’t just contemplate privately. Instead, talk about the book with others. Bring it up in  classes. Write about it. Visualize anythingthat can be visualized about its contents*. All of this helps fix your memory and integrate your new learning into the rest of your knowledge.

（rehearsal明明是预演的意思，但这里似乎是「复习」。向前预期，想想作者会怎么写这本书？向后总结，作者说得对吗，批判性思维。）（用多种模式帮助记忆，multiple modes，听觉、视觉、分享、写作、朗读……）

## Hang in there!

When I give presentations on these ideas, students often tell me a few weeks later that they  “tried it a few times and just couldn’t do it,” so they stopped.

**You will have to practice** these techniques for a considerable length of time — *at least a few months* — before they come to seem natural, and they will never be easier than the comfortable, passive way we’ve all been reading for many years.

Hang in there. **The rewards of these techniques are great**, or so say the hundreds of  students who’ve told me so years later. Learning to read like this can be a critical key to a  successful career as a student, scholar, or professional in almost any field.
